    '        Now in its 10th year the United States Green Building Council&rsquo;s LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) standards define a building&rsquo;s energy efficiency and, as importantly, low-impact and nontoxic construction guidelines.' +
    '        </strong>' +
    '        The project checklist for indoor environmental quality under the new construction and major renovation category can total up to 16 points toward the 40 to 49 points needed for basic LEED Certification.

    '        <h3>How Demountable Glass and Dividing Walls Qualify</h3>' +
    '        <p>' +
    '        <strong>' +
    '        Demountable glass walls are unsurpassed as a means of extending the reach of outside light deep into the workplace, thus helping to score LEED points.' +
    '        </strong>' +
    '        Also noteworthy, natural lighting is recognized as a contributing to workers&rsquo; better health, reducing the feeling of isolation, and improving productivity.   When properly placed in the workplace demountable glass walls can make many if not all interior workspaces a &ldquo;window office&rdquo; with a view to the outside world. ALUR demountable &frac12;&rdquo; tempered glass walls also contribute to acoustic performance or sound management and privacy due to their 36 STC (sound transmission class) rating. This means normal conversations cannot be understood through the glass.' +
    '        </p>' +
    '        <p>' +
    '        <strong>' +
    '        Acoustic performance is further supported by ALUR demountable dividing walls, which are 3.5 inches thick and carry an impressive 42 STC rating.' +
    '        </strong>' +
    '        These walls are used to define the boundaries and function of private offices and conference rooms, and can be seamlessly integrated with ALUR glass walls. Horizontal configurations support office furniture elements as well as AV screens, tackboards, whiteboards, and paper management bins and shelves.  Vertical configurations are used for applications including separating workstations, constructing conference areas and finishing off a run of individual offices.' +
    '        </p>' +
    '        <p>' +
    '        <strong>' +
    '        Glass and the anodized aluminum framing used to construct and support ALUR walls are emission free materials.' +
    '        </strong>' +
    '        Dividing wall panels are also available with low emitting materials to reduce off gassing. These properties contribute to both LEED and GREENGAURD certification.' +
    '        </p>' +
    '        <h3>Office Furniture Systems</h3>' +
    '        <p>' +
    '        <strong>' +
    '        <a href="//alurwalls.com" title="ALUR walls" target="_blank">The ALUR Wall System</a> is designed to compliment office furniture systems by the major brands as well as MAI&rsquo;s own brand of high quality office furniture.' +
    '        </strong>' +
    '        Products include workstations, private office furniture, and free-standing tables for conference rooms and collaboration areas.  These products are GREENGUARD certified and further contribute to LEED points.' +
    '        </p>' +
    '        <h3>Other Contributors to LEED and GEENGUARD Certification</h3>' +
    '        <p>' +
    '        <strong>Modular office components may qualify for points under several classifications found in the LEED checklist for commercial interiors.</strong>' +
    '        Examples include:' +
    '        </p>' +
    '        <ul>' +
    '        <li>' +
    '        <strong>Resource reuse for non-structural components</strong> designed to facilitate moves, adds and changes (MACs) as business needs evolve. Components that are no longer needed can be stored for use later or sold to other users.' +
    '        </li>' +
    '        <li>' +
    '        <strong>Construction Waste Management:</strong> This LEED Materials Resource category is satisfied by bulk packaging and alternatives to traditional corrugated and Styrofoam materials. Cartonless techniques and minimal packaging for truckload orders are other eco-friendly shipping practices.' +
    '        </li>' +
    '        <li>' +
    '        <strong>Resource reuse in furnishings and fixtures:</strong> Wherever possible recycled materials are used in the construction of rugged steel and aluminum structural components. Fabrics are available in recycled materials that are free of heavy metals such as antimony, chlorine and PBT thermoplastic so they can be safely and perpetually recycled and re-manufactured in a closed loop system. 100% post consumer PET Is used for acoustical panels. In short, all components are fully recyclable at the end of their useful life.' +
    '        </li>' +
    '        <li>' +
    '        <strong>EPA requirements include worksurface substrates manufactured from non-wood agricultural fiber, the use of water- or bio-based glues, and using non-toxic dyes and recycled materials in tiles and panels.</strong> Further environmental and cost-saving benefits accrue because panels and other components are colored using powder coating techniques rather than spray painting.' +
    '        </li>' +
    '        <li>' +
    '        <strong>&ldquo;Cradle to cradle&rdquo; processes</strong> focusing on manufacturing products out of parts that can be recycled several times and produced using the least environmentally harmful methods.' +
    '        </li>' +
    '        </ul>' +
    '        <h3>Unsurpassed Quality, Sophisticated Design, Environmentally Friendly</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong><a href="//alurwalls.com" title="ALUR walls" target="_blank">ALUR demountable glass and dividing walls</a> together with a broad range of office furniture options provide businesses, building owners and landlords with outstanding opportunities to create offices that are both environmentally friendly and beautiful.</strong> Office ambiance is becoming increasingly important to recruit and retain environmentally conscious and highly qualified personnel critical to supporting technologically intensive businesses, and to attracting customers.</p>' +

    '        </div>' +
    '        <p><strong>Over the past few years a substantial amount of ink has been expended debating the impact of office design on employee productivity.</strong> Many of these focus on the premise that open office designs encourage collaboration and team building as employees gather formally or informally to discuss their various projects and share ideas that hopefully will lead to new products or processes.</p>' +
    '        <h4>Well-intentioned office designs to promote such interaction have not always proved successful.</h4>' +
    '        <p><strong>A <em>Harvard Business Review</em> article titled <a href="http://hbr.org/2011/07/who-moved-my-cube" title="Who Moved my Cube?" target="_blank">&ldquo;Who Moved my Cube?&rdquo;</a> reports that studies have indicated evidence that removing physical barriers and bringing people closer to one another does promote casual interactions.</strong> But, the article states, there&rsquo;s a roughly equal amount of evidence that because open spaces reduce privacy they don&rsquo;t foster informal exchanges and may actually inhibit them. Some studies show that employees in open-plan spaces, knowing that they may be overheard or interrupted, have shorter and more-superficial discussions than they otherwise would.</p>' +
    '        <p><strong>Similar findings were reported in a Time article <a href="http://ideas.time.com/2012/8/15/why-the-open-office-is-a-hotbed-of-stress/" title="The Open Office is a Hotbed of Stress" target="_blank">&ldquo;Workplace Woes: The &lsquo;Open&rsquo; Office is a Hotbed of Stress.&rdquo;</a></strong> It noted that the noise of the open office is one of employees&rsquo; chief complaints along with lack of privacy.  In the latter case while conversations do take place they tend to be superficial because there are too many ears around.</p>' +
    '        <p><strong>What we have, then, is a distinction between noise and speech privacy.</strong> The distinction is reported in a study undertaken by The Center for the Built Environment (CBE) at UC Berkeley. Survey data were divided into subjective and objective variables. A subjective variable could be an occupant&rsquo;s satisfaction with background noise level or satisfaction with the sound privacy level. In brief the study revealed that people are significantly more dissatisfied with sound privacy than (background) noise level&#42;.</p>' +
    '        <h2>A Common Solution: Demountable Glass and Dividing Walls</h2>' +
    '        <p><strong>Demountable glass and dividing walls provide an elegant solution to muting intrusive and distracting background noise in workspaces.</strong> At the same time they address privacy concerns that inhibit frank discussions during collaborative work sessions – or as sometimes phrased &ldquo;what is said here stays here.&rdquo;</p>' +
    '        <p><strong>As an added benefit modern floor-to-ceiling glass walls provide an office ambiance that is far more &ldquo;open&rdquo; than panel systems and private offices constructed entirely of high panel walls or conventional drywall construction.</strong> Properly positioned glass walls allow natural lighting, with its proven benefits to worker health and productivity, to penetrate deep into the workplace.</p>' +
    '        <p><strong><a href="http://alurwalls.com/" title="ALUR walls" target="_blank">ALUR demountable glass and dividing walls</a> are specifically designed to minimize the distractions of background office noise while providing the sound privacy that encourages frank discussions.</strong></p>' +
    '        <p><strong>ALUR half-inch thick tempered glass delivers an excellent STC (sound transmission class) 36 rating.</strong> This effectively mutes in-workspace or teaming area conversations to the point where they cannot be understood by those on the “outside” while office background noise is kept out of private workspaces and teaming areas.</p>' +

    '        <p><strong>Butt-glazed floor-to-ceiling ALUR demountable glass panels are joined by 93% clear, non-shrinking, non-yellowing polycarbonate joints for noise suppression.</strong> Glass panels are supported by slim, attractively finished and non-obtrusive aluminum channels fitted with compression seals at floors, walls and ceilings. This construction technique, in addition to contributing to sound control, is exceptionally rigid – deflecting less than 0.5 inch at 50 pounds per square foot pressure meeting the 2015 International Building Code, Chapter 24, Section 2403.4 Interior Glazed Areas – an important safety fact.</p>' +
    '        <p><strong>Glass doors, whether swinging or sliding, also extend floor to ceiling and are fitted with seals for enhanced sound attenuation.</strong></p>' +
    '        <p><strong>Options are available to provide visual privacy for glass private offices.</strong> Examples include digital images, decorative films, patterned and frosted glass, all of which contribute to privacy while allowing light transmission.</p>' +
    '        <h3>Demountable Dividing Walls</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>ALUR demountable dividing walls are used to separate individual offices and conference areas.</strong> They are 3.5 inches thick and produced in two configurations, both with an excellent 42 STC rating. Horizontal panels are fitted with tracks at 28.5 and 69 inch heights to support work surfaces, bins, tackboards, AV screens, whiteboards and other office furnishings. They are available in a wide variety of surface finishes and colors to add exciting decorative elements to the overall office design. Vertical panels are used as space dividers or to finish off a line of private offices and conference areas. Both configurations can be used to conceal integrated voice, power and data cabling making them as functional as they are attractive.</p>' +
    '        <h3>Add Sound Masking for Additional Privacy Support</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>While demountable glass and dividing walls provide excellent sound management to address both general office background noise and speech privacy there may be instances where additional protection is necessary.</strong> This can be achieved by incorporating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_masking" title="Wikipedia: sound masking" target="_blank">sound masking</a> using digital generators to create and distribute sound via speakers concealed, for example, in ceilings. The sound is broad band random that conveys no information about itself to personnel. The spectrum is shaped to provide the degree of privacy desired by office staff. Put another way sound is used to mask other sounds (office noise, conversations) to cover them up but not eliminate them. Normal conversation can occur between participants.</p>' +

    '        <h3>The Recruiting Role of Demountable Glass and Dividing Walls</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>Demountable glass walls and dividing walls provide an excellent first impression when prospective employees come in for an interview.</strong> The “wow” factor can begin as early as the entrance and reception area where storefront glass provides a view into the entire facility from the building hallway. The beautifully furnished reception area is similarly separated from office areas by sparkling clear floor to ceiling glass panels with access via sliding or swinging glass doors equipped with sound seals. Accents can include company logos, digital images or decorative films on the glass walls to provide additional privacy and a more customized design.</p>' +
    '        <p><strong>Stepping into the office proper, the prospect is immediately struck by subdued noise levels – a sharp contrast to open office systems with little or no sound management.</strong> This is because ALUR floor-to-ceiling ½" tempered glass provides a 36 STC (sound transmission class) rating that renders normal speech inaudible. Corridor chatter does not distract staff members at their workstations; in-office conversations are kept private from passersby.</p>' +
    '        <p><strong>Further sound management is provided by <a href="http://alurwalls.com/dividing-wall" target="_blank" title="ALUR Dividing Wall">ALUR demountable Dividing Wall</a> with its 42 STC rating.</strong> Solid modular dividing walls fabricated of horizontal panels support office furniture elements including desks, shelves, bins, AV screens, tackboards and whiteboards. They are available in a variety of finishes and fabrics that add color and variety to the office design. Vertical wall elements have a solid look to separate individual work stations, conference areas or finish off a run of individual offices. Dividing walls are able to contain and conceal voice, data and power cabling systems. Interviews with company executives and potential co-workers can be conducted in private meeting rooms, collaboration rooms, a lounge area or the company cafeteria also constructed of ALUR demountable glass and dividing walls with their excellent sound management characteristics.</p>' +
    '        <h3>Design to Maximize Natural Lighting</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>Health and productivity benefits of natural lighting are well documented.</strong> When properly laid out workspaces constructed of demountable glass walls provide visual access to peripheral windows while solid demountable dividing walls are positioned perpendicular to natural light sources.</p>' +
    '        <p>Consider too that comfortable office furnishings, plantings and artwork can add a final touch to convincing talented prospects that your company is interested in their well being and that it is sensitive to the needs of its staff.</p>' +

    '        <h3>Here&rsquo;s why you can accelerate tax depreciation with demountable office walls.</h3>' +
    '            <p>' +
    '            <strong>' +
    '            A major benefit of selecting demountable walls for office build outs is that under IRS Section 179 rules demountable walls qualify for accelerated tax depreciation.' +
    '            </strong> As described in IRS publication 946 &ldquo;How to Depreciate Property&rdquo; demountable walls fall under asset class 00.11: office furniture, fixtures and equipment. This classification includes furniture and fixtures that are not a structural component of a building (emphasis ours). This is in sharp contrast to drywall construction that is considered a structural component.' +
    '            </p>' +
    '            <p>' +
    '            The difference is substantial, and clearly provides a financial incentive for building owners, building managers, and company facility managers to select demountable walls for new or remodeled office floor plans. Using the IRS general depreciation system (GDS) under the modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS) <a href="http://officeofthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Tax-Benefits-of-Modular-Architectural-Walls.pdf" target="_blank" title="Tax Benefits of Modular Architectural Walls">ALUR demountable glass walls and modular dividing wall systems qualify for a 7-year depreciation schedule</a> vs. 39 years for drywall construction.' +
    '            </p>' +
    '            <h3>Other Business and Financial Incentives for Demountable Walls</h3>' +
    '            <p>' +
    '            In addition to accelerated tax depreciation, there are indirect financial incentives to install demountable walls in new or refurbished office space.' +
    '            </p>' +
    '            <p>' +
    '            <strong>' +
    '            Flexibility' +
    '            </strong>' +
    '            is an important consideration because movable wall systems can be reconfigured faster and at far less cost to accommodate changes in office layouts or when changes are made to office floor plan to accommodate growth and other office needs.' +
    '            </p>' +
    '            <p>' +
    '            Modern, attractive glass wall workspaces, conferences and break rooms provide an open, airy atmosphere that helps companies attract highly qualified staff in competitive recruiting environments and reduce costs associated with employee turnover.' +

    '<p><strong>Not too long ago a window office was deemed a sign of prestige by co-workers confined to Dilbert-like cubicles in the office bullpen.</strong>  Natural light and a view of the outside world give windowed office occupants a feeling of well-being that a recent study indicates contributes to better health. The study also indicates that workers in windowed offices have more physical activity and a better quality of life than those without windows.</p>' +
    '        <p>A summary of the study reported in a Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine release noted that &ldquo;Architects need to be aware of the importance of natural light not only in terms of their potential energy savings but also in terms of affecting occupants&rsquo; health.&rdquo; A recommendation was to make sure that workers are within 20 to 25 feet of peripheral walls containing windows.</p>' +
    '        <p>The benefits of natural lighting are widely acknowledged by organizations such as the International Interior Design Association, the American Institute of Architects and CoreNet Global, and are a strong contributor to a facility accumulating points toward a LEED certification.</p>' +

    '        <p><strong>Locating offices and workspaces within 25 feet of windows may not be achievable in facilities with extensive floor areas.</strong> The answer, then, is to move away from workspaces enclosed by drywall construction and more toward glass demountable walls. When properly designed and installed, glass wall systems serve as a &ldquo;window to the windows&rdquo; bringing natural light and visual contact with the outside world to all company personnel. Now everyone can have a &ldquo;window office.&rdquo;</p>' +

    '        <h3>Benefits go beyond imparting a feeling of well-being to office personnel</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>Open plan systems with low panel dividers are the current design of choice with the stated purpose of encouraging employee collaboration and team building.</strong> But these types of office designs have come under increased criticism because of noise distraction and privacy issues. </p>' +
    '        <p><strong>For example, an indoor environmental quality survey conducted by the Center for the Built Environment at the University of California Berkeley looked at noise levels and sound privacy levels.</strong> The survey disclosed that people are more dissatisfied with sound privacy than noise level. Participants&rsquo; self-rated job performance shows that more than 60% of cubicle occupants think acoustics interfere with their ability to get the job done. The noise distraction issue is covered more extensively in our post on collaboration and socialization.</p>' +
    '        <p><strong>Floor-to-ceiling demountable glass wall offices come to the rescue here as well.</strong> In the case of private offices they admit natural light but eliminate distracting outer office noise. When used to construct team areas or common areas such as meeting rooms and break rooms they contain noise instead of letting it spill over to adjacent work areas. ALUR demountable glass walls, constructed of ½" thick tempered glass, have a 36 STC (Sound Transmission Class), making normal speech practically inaudible.</p>' +
    '        <h3>A Solution as Beautiful as it is Practical</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>The ALUR glass wall system was designed from the start to set it apart from traditional glazing.</strong> Traditional butt glazed solutions are characterized by bulky, unattractive framing, silicone wet joints and lack of door seals. The silicone joints will shrink and discolor over time and do not provide the necessary rigidity to meet building code deflection standards, especially at taller ceiling heights. Doors without proper sound seals result in significant sound loss by allowing the sound to &ldquo;leak&rdquo; through the gaps around the door. Some of the features found on the ALUR design include:' +
    '        <ul>' +
    '        <li>Slim, elegantly designed wall, floor and ceiling channels with integral compression seals for better sound control and stability</li>' +
    '        <li>Scratch and fingerprint resistant bead-blasted aluminum finish</li>' +
    '        <li>½" butt- glazed glass panels joined by 93% clear, non-shrinking, non-yellowing polycarbonate for noise suppression and enhanced rigidity</li>' +
    '        <li>Frameless floor-to-ceiling hinged or space-saving, quietly operating sliding glass doors</li>' +
    '        <li> Sound seals on doors, including compression seal options on both pivot and sliding doors for optimal sound attenuation</li>' +
    '        </ul>' +
    '        <p>Visual privacy issues can be addressed in several ways without seriously impacting the flow of natural light. An example is printing digital images on the glass, allowing light to pass through but providing privacy for office occupants. Decorative films and the use of solid or patterned frosted glass are other examples.</p>' +
    '        <h3>Solid Demountable Dividing Walls</h3>' +
    '        <p>Ideally interior glass walls should be positioned to provide maximum exposure to the building&rsquo;s windows. Solid demountable dividing walls used to separate individual offices and conference areas should be perpendicular to outside walls whenever possible.</p>' +
    '        <p><strong><a title="alurwalls.com" href="//alurwalls.com/dividing-wall" target="_blank">ALUR Dividing Wall</a> is available in two configurations, both of which provide excellent sound suppression while adding attractive design elements and outstanding practicality to the office space.</strong> Tile options include thermofused melamine, fabric wrapped, markerboard, tackable acoustical and premium &ldquo;wood look&rdquo; laminates. The panels are able to conceal integrated voice, data and power cabling.</p>' +
    '        <p><strong>Horizontal panels are designed to support off-modular office furniture elements including worksurfaces, shelving, bins, tackboards, whiteboards, and AV screens.</strong> These are suspended from tracks at 28.5 and 69 inch heights. Vertical panels have tight seams for an elegant monolithic look ideally suited to finish off the wall at the end of run or as simple space dividers between offices. Both configurations are 3.5 inches thick and provide a seamless transition to floor-to-ceiling glass wall panels. The ALUR Dividing Wall also provides an exceptionally high 42 STC. (i.e. 5&rdquo; drywall with insulation is a 39 STC)</p>' +
    '        <p><strong>As another attractive design element is the seamless connection between the ALUR glass nib wall (i.e. sidelight in sidewall) and the ALUR dividing sidewall.</strong> A similar application is accomplished with drywall sidewall but with a post where the glass meets the drywall. This attractive feature makes offices seem larger to occupants with the added benefit of admitting more natural light to the work area.</p>' +

    '        <p><strong>But these systems are also highly advantageous from strictly a financial viewpoint.</strong> Because they are considered furniture demountable walls can utilize a greatly accelerated 7-year depreciation schedule vs. the 39 years that apply to conventional drywall build-outs.  And unlike plasterboard-on-stud construction demountable walls are movable. Adapting to changing requirements in the office does not require the cost, mess and disposal challenges associated with conventional design demolition and rebuilds.</p>' +

    '        <p>One if the key advantages of the <a title="ALUR dividing wall" href="//alurwalls.com/" target="_blank">ALUR system</a> is that it is based on demountable glass walls and solid dividing walls.

    '        <h4>The difference is that demountable walls can be reused. That&rsquo;s a big advantage in several ways&hellip;</h4>' +
    '        <ul>' +
    '            <li><strong>Today&rsquo;s office floor plans are seldom static.</strong> Changing business requirements, personnel shifts and other factors contribute to what are called Moves, Adds and Changes (MACs) in the office. What works well this year may not next year. Demountable walls accommodate these changes with a minimum of disruption.</li>' +
    '            <li>Because they are considered office furnishings rather than office construction <strong>demountable walls qualify for accelerated tax depreciation.</strong></li>' +
    '            <li><strong>They do not require building permits</strong> in many states.</li>' +
    '            <li><strong>They can contribute to <a title="LEED points"  href="//www.usgbc.org/leed" target="_blank">LEED points.</a></strong></li>' +

    '        </ul>' +
    '        <h2>Other Comparison Considerations</h2>' +
    '        <h4>Glass Joining Considerations</h4>' +
    '        <p><strong>Glass-to-glass joints are an important consideration if the desire is to maximize the light effect and create an expanse of seemingly unsupported walls surrounding common areas such conference rooms or break areas.</strong> The low profile framing is heavy duty for extra rigidity and has compression gaskets that firmly hold ½-inch tempered glass panels in place. The gaskets also serve to minimize sound transference through the wall</p>' +
    '        <p>What distinguishes ALUR demountable glass walls from typical butt glazing and wet joints is the use of a dry joints and tongue and groove design (i.e. specially shaped glass edges coupled with polycarbonate joints that are 93% clear and will not discolor or shrink over time). Together with framing channels, these walls minimize sound leakage, resist bowing, and are extremely rigid – deflecting less than 0.4 inch when a force of 50 pounds per linear foot of pressure is applied horizontally to a 4&#39; wide by 10&#39; high piece of glass.</p>' +
    '        <h4>Project Management Considerations</h4>' +
    '        <p>Constructed walls can lead to project management challenges for a number of reasons:</p>' +
    '        <ol>' +
    '            <li>Building permit delays and bureaucracy issues</li>' +
    '            <li>Multiple trades involved in the project</li>' +
    '            <li>Extended installation time</li>' +
    '            </li>' +
    '        </ol>' +
    '        <p>These challenges are eliminated or substantially reduced when building owners and facility managers select demountable walls:</p>' +
    '        <ol>' +
    '            <li>The permitting issue may be eliminated because demountable glass walls are considered furniture</li>' +
    '            <li>Multiple trades are reduced to a single trade to expedite project management and installation</li>' +
    '            <li>Installation time is reduced since walls are prefabricated off site</li>' +
    '        </ol>' +
    '        <p>A point to keep in mind when it comes to project management for pre-built space is that expedited shipping of only the extrusions, or ordering from a limited selection of stock components, can cut the lead time in half. ALUR glass and dividing wall tiles are sourced locally, meaning that they get to the job site in 2 to 3 weeks after verification of site dimensions.</p>' +

    '        <p>We call this &ldquo;the case of the incredible shrinking office.&rdquo; The cause, in major growing markets, is the increasing cost of office space that forces the reduction of square footage allotted to each employee. In our presentations we note the reduction to 175 SF from 225 SF. But we have made offices as small as 64 SF.</p>' +
    '        <p>The challenge is finding an office plan that supports both collaboration and the need for private thinking time without the noise distractions. Interestingly, the Bernstein article includes transparency in its title and lists in a table unintended consequences of open offices across the intended objectives of accountability, collaboration, innovation and knowledge sharing.* </p>' +
    '        <em><small>*Dr. Bernstein&rsquo;s article describes transparency in terms of open office collaboration, feedback and evaluation.</small></em>' +
    '        <h3>Workplace Transparency and Glass Dividing Walls</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>Demountable glass and solid dividing walls, we believe, are an attractive and effective solution to reconciling the conflict between quiet privacy and non-distractive collaboration.</strong> As more staff are shoehorned into smaller spaces glass walls provide visibility and a sense of spaciousness. In a properly designed floor plan they also admit natural light from exterior windows. Small offices seem bigger and natural light feels warmer. The added benefit of the <a title="ALUR dividing wall" href="http://alurwalls.com/" target="_blank">ALUR system</a> is sound privacy delivered by its ½-inch thick tempered glass with a 36 Sound Transmission Class (STC) rating. This means that normal speech is practically inaudible at this rating.</p>' +

    '            <img src="/posts/_graphic_wraps_enhance_privacy.jpg" alt="ALUR glass walls" class="responsive-img" /> <em><small>Overlays provide privacy without sacrificing openness.</small></em>' +
    '        </div>' +
    '        <p><strong>Ad hoc and scheduled collaboration sessions are supported when office planners provide team-meeting rooms enclosed with demountable glass wall systems.</strong> As small private office glass walls keep out external noise and distractions, glass walled collaboration areas contain noise so as to not distract occupants at neighboring workstations. In this way conference area &ldquo;noise management&rdquo;, as we like to call it, without imparting a feeling of confinement.</p>' +
    '        <p>And as noted in our post on collaboration and socialization, company facilities once relegated to back corner &ldquo;out of sight out of mind&rdquo; status (cue the office kitchen) have gained new prominence. When the &ldquo;company caf&eacute;&rdquo; is brought out of the closet with stunning glass wall partitions, attractive and comfortable furniture, network access and perhaps artwork and plantings, it not only improves collaboration and productivity but also helps attract new talent. Some call it community space.</p>' +
    '        <h3>Dividing Options for Demountable Glass Wall Offices</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>Demountable glass wall offices can be much more than glass boxes.</strong> Most glass systems offer insulated solid dividing options that serve as simple space dividers between offices or to provide support for shelving, bins, cabinetry, AV screens, whiteboards and similar functional attachments. When feasible these dividers should be positioned perpendicular to exterior windows so as not to block natural light.</p>' +
    '        <p>Dividing walls have typically extended from the front to the back of individual offices or conference areas. But as the square footage allotted to employees drops these solid dividing walls tend to create a more confined feeling despite front and back glass partitions.</p>' +
    '        <p>We&rsquo;ve addressed this by introducing the ALUR nib wall design. This is simply glass sidelights butted against solid dividing walls and attached to the front by transparent polycarbonate dry joints in an L, T or 135&deg; 3-way configuration. This option not only makes the office appear larger to the occupant, but also admits more light. The L and T polycarbonate joints also allow for a continuous glass wall across the office fronts (i.e. no mullion or posts) for a cleaner more elegant look.</p>' +
    '        <h3>Glass Wall Design Options for Light and Privacy.</h3>' +
    '        <p>Visual privacy may be a requirement for certain offices in businesses fitted with glass wall systems. Examples are HR offices where confidential discussions take place and where employees or prospective hires may be uncomfortable being viewed by passersby. The same requirements may apply to the company&rsquo;s legal department.</p>' +
    '        <p>In these instances applied or decorative film and frosted glass panels provide light and privacy without detracting from the overall office ambiance. </p>' +
    '        <p>Another glass treatment is a new technique that allows digital printed images on glass. While it does not contribute to privacy it provides contrast and can be used to visually distinguish various departments in the company. There is also switchable glass that uses electric current to change the visual appearance of glass from opaque to transparent.</p>' +
    '        <h3>Space Saving Advantages of Sliding Glass Doors</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>As office space per employee shrinks consideration must be given to the space taken up when opening conventional hinged office doors – approximately 9 SF that intrudes into the office.</strong> The beautifully designed ALUR sliding glass door addresses this head on. This configuration is also called by some as a barn door design. But unlike conventional sliding glass doors the ALUR design has a hidden mechanism and slides silently open and closed to indicate that the occupant is open for a visit or engaged in private think time.</p>' +
    '        <h3>Cost Saving and Tax Saving Movable Glass Walls</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>As companies, building owners and designers cope with packing more into less the benefits of movable glass walls becomes more and more appealing.</strong> We have seen in this post how they can be configured to accommodate smaller workspaces while providing a feeling of openness and privacy at the same time. </p>' +
    '        <p>These systems are less costly over the long term than conventional stud and drywall configurations because they can be reconfigured to accommodate changes in floor plans, eliminating construction debris associated with knocking down and rebuilding stud and drywall construction.</p>' +

    '        <p><strong>&ldquo;Glass is glass&rdquo;, right? Wrong.</strong> Your first consideration is the glass itself. Clear glass walls are usually offered as tempered or laminated panels. ALUR glass walls use &frac12;&quot; thick tempered glass as its standard but ALUR can accommodate any &frac12;&quot; material. The reason for this is safety. In a test of panels for a 9&#39;-6&quot; ceiling height at a pressure of 5 pounds per square foot tempered glass deflected at an acceptable 0.84&quot; whereas laminated glass deflected 3.5&quot; – more than 4 times that of the tempered glass. Increased deflection creates a potential safety issue for employees if they lean on the glass.</p>' +
    '        <p>There are 3 basic methods for creating glass-to-glass (butt-glazing) connections: silicone tape, &ldquo;wet&rdquo; joints and &ldquo;dry&rdquo; joints. It is our recommendation that &ldquo;dry&rdquo; joints be specified in your RFP. Dry joints are the most attractive in appearance, provide the best rigidity at connection points and offer the best sound attenuation than the other methods. ALUR panel edges are flat polished and chamfered to a precise angle forming a virtually seamless fit when using polycarbonate dry joints available as inline, angular &ldquo;L&rdquo;, &ldquo;T&rdquo; and 135&deg; (3-way) connector configurations. Polycarbonate, unlike silicon joints, has a 93% transparency rate and will not discolor or shrink over time and separate from the glass.</p>' +
    '        <p>Visual privacy concerns when using glass wall systems can be easily addressed. Specifying frosted tempered glass or applying translucent solid or decorative window films creates a glass &ldquo;private office&rdquo;.</p>' +
    '        <h3>Glass Wall Framing Considerations</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>We recommend specifying a &ldquo;stick built&rdquo; demountable glass wall systems as compared with unitized systems.</strong> Stick-built systems include vertical and horizontal framing members that can be used in a variety of combinations and can be cut or modified on site for a better fit. In most instances unitized systems have framing that fixes height and width dimensions thereby limiting adaptations to field conditions such as uneven floors or walls.</p>' +
    '        <p>ALUR glass walls are supported by very sleek, low profile floor and ceiling channels to firmly hold glass panels. Floor and ceiling channels come in long lengths to minimize seams, and corners are cut at the factory to provide a perfect fit. Any seams in the framing are matched with the glass joints for a more elegant look. In ALUR postless configurations the only vertical channels are where the ALUR glass wall meets up with drywall (see below). Aluminum floor, ceiling and wall channels are bead-blasted to create a scratch-resistant and fingerprint-hiding surface, and are fitted with compression gasket inserts that seal the glass in and further contribute to noise reduction. Bead-blasted aluminum finish also provides a beautiful luminescent non-reflective type finish.</p>' +
    '        <h3>Dividing Wall Specification Tips</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>Dividing walls are used to separate work areas that are fronted and backed with clear glass walls or backed by exterior building walls. </strong>They can also be used for back walls if glass proves impractical or to separate public and private areas in the office.</p>' +
    '        <p>We recommended specifying dividing walls offered in both vertical and horizontal panels or tiles. What is the difference? Vertical wall panels should be used as space dividers only and not to support office furniture components at the end of a bank of offices for example. This will provide tighter seams for a more unified appearance and better sound control. Horizontal wall panels should be used for interior office walls with built in tracks at 28.5&quot; and 69&quot; to accept off-modular attachments of worksurfaces and cabinets, and functional tile options such as whiteboards, tackable/acoustical surfaces, decorative laminate options and monitor screens.</p>' +
    '        <p>ALUR insulated dividing walls are only 3.5&quot; thick, yet provide exceptional sound privacy (42 STC) and are available in several tile finish options. In the horizontal configuration they accommodate hang-on furniture and integrated plug-and-play ALUR modular power, voice and data cabling systems. Both configurations integrate perfectly with ALUR glass partitions.</p>' +

    '        <h3>Specifying Door Options for Glass Wall Systems</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>Safety and security are essential in all office settings</strong>. Two types of doors are available for most demountable glass wall systems. Framed doors are framed all the way the around with glass in the center. Framed doors are the least attractive and typically lower cost. We recommend specifying frameless glass doors that extend from floor to ceiling to compliment the floor to ceiling glass walls. One option usually selected for main entrances and restricted work areas uses pivot hinges and closers and ladder pulls. These doors can be fitted with mag locks and card readers for greater security.</p>' +
    '        <p>For interior spaces a popular option is beautifully designed and highly functional sliding glass doors, also called frameless glass barn doors. Sliding doors also take up less floor space conserving 9 square feet required for a pivot door. Unlike bulky and costly sliding doors generally used by contractors we recommend sliding doors that conceal the sliding mechanism on the backside of the top frame. The mechanism therefore is not visible from the approach side.</p>' +
    '        <p>ALUR sliding doors have brush gaskets at top and sides and an optional brush seal at bottom for superior sound management. Because they slide rather than swing ALUR barn door designs do not intrude – either into the office space or into corridors ALUR sliding doors are offered with both locking and non-locking ladder type pulls. Locking ladder pulls are ADA complaint.</p>' +
    '        <h3>Local Glass Sourcing to Save Time and Money</h3>' +
    '        <strong>We recommend you specify glass wall systems that source all their glass locally as standard practice.</strong> This will save on freight cost, improve lead times and reduce the overall carbon footprint' +
    '        <h3>Understanding Post and Postless Glass Wall Systems</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>This blog post focuses most on postless glass wall system using low profile aluminum channels at wall connections and strips and gaskets at doors.</strong> In addition to providing a sleeker design, postless installations require less aluminum structural elements with resultant lower cost. ALUR is also available with aluminum posts at doors and walls. This provides installers with a degree of flexibility in wall-to-wall dimensions and in providing better seals when used with pivot doors. The professionals at ALUR will be glad to work with you in making the decision to specify post or postless configurations.</p>' +
    '        <h3>Don&rsquo;t Neglect the Importance of Adaptability</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>When you specify movable glass wall systems remember that components should be adaptable to building conditions during the initial installation and later to accommodate changes in the office layout.</strong> Also, the wall system should fit into a standard construction schedule and not have forced &ldquo;hold&rdquo; dimensions that could extend the lead-time. <a title="ALURwalls.com" href="http://alurwalls.com/" target="_blank">The ALUR system</a> is designed to conform to a variety of building conditions such as uneven floors, walls and ceilings and because of the on site framing and local glass sourcing does not require specific hold dimensions.</p>' +

    '        </div>' +
    '<p><strong>Attitudes regarding the value of the open office concept are undergoing changes being led by the realization that collaboration is essential to a company’s success.</strong> HR departments and top management are taking a closer look at new ways to better promote collaboration and socialization. Attention has turned to creating attractive, functional work environments that enhance the work experience to attract the best employees and keep them working at their optimum performance throughout the entire workday.</p>' +
    '        <p>One great example is the transition of the traditional office kitchens and break areas into attractive combination spaces in the open office area, to encourage employees to “stay in” for lunch and thereby remain more focused and productive, and to encourage collaboration throughout the rest of the work day.</p>' +
    '        <h4>Two recent examples come to mind:</h4>' +
    '        <table>' +
    '        <td style="padding: 30px"><em><span style="font-size:125%"><strong>An article in The New York Times</strong> noted that the tourist crush in the Times Square area was discouraging office employees from navigating the throngs when going out for lunch, and that the 30 minute lunch is nearly impossible because restaurants are jammed with visitors. One way to counteract this was put into play in a Broadway skyscraper where a cafeteria and gym were installed encouraging tenants&rsquo; employees to stay inside. <br/><br/>' +
    '        <strong>A Los Angeles Times article</strong> on collaborative workspaces noted that plush kitchens doubling as workrooms are impressing employees, recruits and visitors alike, and that designs call for natural light, great food and coffee, and comfortable furniture.</span></em></td>' +
    '        </table>' +
    '        <h3>Collaboration without Distraction: ALUR Wall System</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>Numerous research studies have shown, there is a fine line between collaboration and unwanted distraction.</strong> Too much of one or the other can seriously inhibit worker satisfaction and productivity. In the early years of open office design the conversational “noise” spilled over into adjacent cubicles causing great distraction to the entire office. One solution was to create solid modular floor-to-ceiling walls with the intent to diminish noise distraction and provide the ability to reconfigure workspaces at a later date. While accomplishing the goal of increased flexibility, this solution often resulted in occupants feeling both “closed in” and suffering the loss of natural light from exterior windows, – a very important consideration noted in the LA Times article.</p>' +
    '        <p><a title="ALUR Glass Wall" href="http://alurwalls.com/glass-wall">ALUR demountable glass wall systems</a> provide a perfect and elegant solution to promote collaboration and equally important socialization among employees without the downside of the traditional open office and solid walls. The ALUR wall system is being installed in today’s high-technology companies, marketing firms, law partnerships, and in any other organization where sharing ideas is essential to success.</p>' +
    '        <p>Interior glass walls are also ideal for individual offices where staff members must have a place to get away and be alone for quiet think time. In fact a major benefit of ALUR movable glass walls is that they can be reconfigured at less cost than drywall and its associated construction debris and downtime. This feature allows business owners and landlords to implement floor plan changes that accommodate changing space requirements.</p>' +
    '        <h3>Open and Private Thanks to Advanced Sound Management</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>Natural daylight and outside views are highly prized in workplace environments and for years were among the benefits of being in upper management.</strong> Now all company personnel can enjoy these “bennies” because of the sound management properties of ALUR walls.</p>' +
    '        <p>Below are two tables offering a synopsis of the effects of typical office walls and partitions. The upper portion of the accompanying table describes sound transmission class (STC) ratings and the effect on privacy. The lower portion compares STC ratings for typical walls and partitions. ALUR ½" tempered glass provides an impressive STC 36 rating.</p>' +
    '        <p>The <a title="ALUR Dividing Wall" href="http://alurwalls.com/dividing-wall">ALUR solid dividing wall</a> increases this to an STC of 42. They are often used as sidewalls to divide private offices and allow the attachment of furniture components such as desks and cabinets, or support marker board and AV components. Sound masking products are available to provide additional sound management solutions.</p>' +
    '        <h4>Ratings and Privacy</h4>' +

    '        <p>A greater sense of visual privacy, without reducing the sense of openness, can be achieved by covering portions of the clear glass walls with frosted, graphic and patterned window films. Another option is ordering ALUR frosted tempered glass or white laminated annealed glass.</p>' +
    '        <h3>“De-Isolate” Reception Areas with Glass Walls</h3>' +
    '        <strong>Customers, vendors and potential employees like to see what’s going on behind the reception area.</strong> What better way to provide this insight than glass walls between the reception area and action central where things are happening. A well-thought-out office plan will provide reception area guests a broad vista of private and collaborative spaces, socializing areas, the kitchen/café and other office amenities all supported by ALUR demountable glass walls and, where appropriate, ALUR dividing walls.' +
    '        Reception area glass walls (as with all glass front offices) can be fitted with locks and custom after market electromagnetic locks for extra security' +
    '        <h3>ALUR Glass Walls Promote Imaginative Thinking</h3>' +
    '        <strong>Tremendous progress is being made in creating imaginative office layouts by installing open, airy glass wall offices supported by attractively furnished kitchens, break areas and reception areas.</strong> The Office of the Future is here today, thanks to ALUR demountable glass and dividing walls along with desking systems and sound masking.

    '<p><strong>At <a href="http://alurwalls.com/">ALUR</a>, we believe companies, landlords, building managers and workers can all benefit from demountable glass wall offices such as ALUR&rsquo;s ALUR line.</strong>' +
    '        Note, that when referring to costs, we are referring to long-term costs — those beyond initial installation.</p>' +
    '        <h2>Cost Benefits of Demountable Walls</h2>' +
    '        <h3>Lease Benefits</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>Unlike plasterboard-on-stud office walls described as fixed installations, demountable glass walls may help convince landlords to provide more favorable lease terms.</strong> This is because the space is more marketable to future tenants and they are not faced with demolition and its associated mess and costs if tenants decide to pick up and move. Demountable glass walls can also increase the building valuation. In addition, the hassle of building permits can be avoided in most states, which can save both time and money.</p>' +
    '        <h3>Tax Benefits vs. Construction</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>In general, demountable walls are considered equipment, thus allowing a company to completely write off the expenditure over 5 times faster than typical construction.</strong> With current tax laws, the bottom line is that conventional construction initial cost would need to be at least 32% lower to match the tax advantages of a demountable wall system like ALUR.</p>' +
    '        <h3>Lower Move In Costs</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>Lower move in costs may also apply and here is where prefabricated, demountable walls shine.</strong> Let’s not forget that move in costs start with the signing of the lease. If you are the tenant the time between signing and occupancy is money that goes out of your pocket into the building owner’s pocket. The construction period can be reduced with off-site manufacturing and delivery of installation-ready components to the job site.</p>' +
    '        <h3>Time Savings</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>Unlike modular walls that require verification of site as-built dimensions prior to ordering, ALUR framing is oversized.</strong> This means product can be ordered early based on construction drawings. Since <a title="ALUR Glass Wall" href="http://alurwalls.com/glass-wall">ALUR glass panels</a> are provided locally the lead-time is effectively reduced to only the time it takes to get them to the job site after verification of site dimensions. In most cases this is only two to three weeks.</p>' +
    '        <p>Installation is also facilitated because the product is highly adaptable to building conditions and can accommodate changes in variables that may arise – such as uneven floors, fixed walls and ceilings. To put it another way, framing is oversized and cut to fit on site, with glass and solid tiles ordered based on final opening size. Added costs such as floating the floor are avoided.</p>' +
    '        <p>As another point, the single piece ceiling and floor framing for glass dividing walls is attached with fewer steps. And modular power and data outlets can be built-in to the walls to save time.</p>' +
    '        <h2>Productivity up with Demountable <br>Glass Wall Offices</h2>' +
    '        <div class="post-media">' +
    '            <img class="" src="/posts/_let_the_sun_shine_in_590x393.jpg" alt="ALUR glass wall corner detail" class="responsive-img" />' +
    '        </div>' +
    '        <p><strong>When talking about productivity we need to call attention to the ongoing debate concerning advantages and disadvantages of open office systems.</strong> You’ll get all sorts of opinions and referred to a host of studies on open office design. One point upon which most agree is that noise distractions do adversely affect productivity. Noise is probably the most prevalent annoyance source in offices, which can lead to increased stress for occupants. Another important point is speech privacy.</p>' +
    '        <p>Open office designs based on the cubicle concept encourage collaboration and provide the workforce with a feeling of spaciousness and not being cooped in. Natural lighting from periphery windows can also equate to having a window office, certainly a prestige point in the minds of many employees.</p>' +
    '        <p>ALUR floor to ceiling glass walls address both issues in a positive way. The system is designed for maximum sound attenuation due to the use of premium ½-inch tempered glass that delivers an impressive 36 STC (sound transmission class) rating, addressing the need for privacy while keeping out noise.</p>' +
    '        <p>To the question what does that mean? Well, normal speech is rendered inaudible at the 36 STC rating. The <a title="ALUR Dividing Wall" href="http://alurwalls.com/dividing-wall">ALUR dividing wall</a> offers an even greater STC of 42 for complete speech privacy. If further sound management is required, such as masking excited discussions in working groups, sound masking products work with the glass dividing walls to deliver a comprehensive acoustical solution. Moreover they are HIPA and GBLA compliant, offering uniform, non-disturbing masking sound throughout offices and team meeting areas.</p>' +
    '        <h3>Let the Sunshine In with Interior Glass Walls</h3>' +
    '        <p><strong>This is where our ALUR system excels.</strong> Our interior glass walls provide a truly open environment but without the noise and distraction drawbacks of most open office plans, while providing beautiful, open, and airy workspaces that maximize natural daylight. When glass front offices are fitted with our lockable pivot or super sleek sliding glass doors it’s easy for occupants to signal they are open for discussions (i.e. the door is open) or come back later.</p>' +
    '        <p>ALUR private offices can be equipped with freestanding furniture and/or furniture systems components integrated into the 3.5 inch thick ALUR dividing wall. These modular, dividing walls can also be fitted with custom cabinetry, Smart Boards, flat screen monitors and other equipment. We recommend that ALUR solid dividing walls be connected to our ALUR glass front wall with a one or two foot glass fin wall, thereby increasing the perceived size of the office and enhancing the views to the great outdoors.</p>' +
    '        <p>In summary, the ALUR demountable wall system does in fact contribute to keeping costs down and to increasing productivity. Furthermore, modern, beautiful and sustainable interiors have been shown to help attract and retain high quality employees in 21st Century workspaces. The system deserves serious consideration by office managers and building owners having these objectives in mind.</p>' +

    '        </strong>' +
    '        Prospective tenants look for substantial tenant improvement (TI) allowances that can cost $105 to $140 per square foot or more for a conventional build out and furniture in Class A space. This cost combines an estimated TI cost of $75-$100 per square foot and furniture, fixtures and equipment (FF&E) at $30 to $40 per square foot.' +
    '        </p>' +
    '        <p>' +
    '        In addition to these expenditures there is time that landlords and staff must devote to designing the space, selecting vendors and supervising the installation. In the back of the mind there is also the nagging question &ldquo;how long will the tenants stay and what do I do with the space if they vacate it?&rdquo;' +

    '        <p>' +
    '        <strong>' +
    '        Although some tenants may favor turnkey solutions to readying space for occupancy the process is typically expensive and complex.' +
    '        </strong>' +
    '        Those drawbacks are now fully addressed by a program devised by ALUR.' +

    '        <strong><a href="//alurwalls.com" title="ALUR">ALUR</a> is the premier provider of modular office furniture systems, plug-and-play power and data cable management systems, storage systems, and demountable ALUR Glass Wall and ALUR Dividing Wall systems.' +
    '        </strong>' +
    '        Together these components provide unsurpassed efficiency in readying warm space for occupancy while easily accommodating later moves, adds and changes desired by existing tenants or future tenants. An added bonus for landlords is that demountable walls, as with office furniture, qualify for significant tax depreciation allowances described in our post on <a href="//officeofthefuture.com/demountable-walls-and-section-179-tax-depreciation">IRS Section 179.</a>' +

    '        </strong>' +
    '        And with rising construction costs, many building owners and managers are reluctant to invest in fully built-out spaces using conventional drywall construction &ldquo;on spec&rdquo; as a means of attracting new tenants.' +

    '        <p>' +
    '        <strong>' +
    '        Changes in the office rental marketplace have necessitated a rethinking on the part of building owners and managers to meet the expectations of a new breed of tenant.' +
    '        </strong>' +
    '        Today&rsquo;s prospective tenants seek high tech, high class and beautifully designed offices that are crucial to attracting the highly qualified personnel needed for their businesses to succeed.

The author suggests answering the question &ldquo;what about this space compels people to want to occupy it in the first place?&rdquo; He noted that people will show up for work no matter what, but they&rsquo;ll show up with enthusiasm and vigor if their workspace presents the possibility for an enjoyable experience.' +

Amenities are described as &ldquo;lounges and cafeterias to health and wellness centers—a whole bandwidth of things that aren&rsquo;t desks and offices.&rdquo; Together these are described as placemaking &#8211; a place where people like to be.' +

    '        Zoned electrical and flexible HVAC and sprinkler systems can be modified with relative ease to conform to new and future tenants&rsquo; floor plans.

Workspace or workplace entry is achieved with conventional swinging or space-saving sliding glass doors.</p>' +
    '        <p><strong>Insulated ALUR demountable dividing walls in horizontal and vertical configurations are used to separate work areas fronted and/or backed with demountable glass walls.</strong> In the horizontal configuration dividing walls support office furniture including worksurfaces, shelves, bins, tackboards, whiteboards and AV monitors on built-in tracks at 28.5 and 69 inch heights. They also carry concealed power, voice and data cabling systems.</p>' +
    '        <p><strong>Vertical tile configurations are typically used as space dividers for office back walls where glass is impractical, and at the end of a row of offices.</strong></p>' +

    '        <p>' +
    '        <strong>Reconciling staff expectations with floor space cost is eased by reducing what can be called wasted space in today&rsquo;s offices.</strong> This is achieved by making every square foot &ldquo;carry its load.&rdquo; One way to increase usable floor space is specifying sliding glass doors vs. swinging or pivot doors wherever feasible.' +
    '        </p>' +
    '        <h2>Substantial Space Savings with Glass Sliding Doors</h2>' +
    '        <p>' +
    '        <strong>Sliding doors &mdash; sometimes referred to as barn doors &mdash; are not new.</strong> Another variation is a pocket door that were frequently found in Victorian homes. Doors slip into wall &ldquo;pockets&rdquo; and are closed or opened without taking up floor space. Although out of favor for many years in the residential market, sliding doors are making a comeback as a space saving feature for bedrooms, bathrooms, closets, laundries and utility rooms.' +
    '        </p>' +
    '        <h2>How much space can be saved? In a word, substantial.</h2>' +
    '        <p>' +
    '        <strong>Think about it. A pivot door requires space for the door itself and the path of its swing.</strong> For example, a 32 x 80 inch pivot door consumes more than 14 square feet of space to make a full 180&deg; swing. This is space that cannot be used for office equipment or anything else for that matter, except perhaps pictures on the wall protected by a doorstop. Multiply the number of doors in a facility by 14 or the appropriate calculation based on door size. You’ll quickly determine that the amount of saved space is, indeed, substantial.' +
    '        </p>' +
    '        <p>' +
    '        <strong>Sliding doors, in contrast, require only the space of the door itself.</strong> A 2&quot; thick 32 x 80 inch wood or metal sliding door needs only 2 inches of space to slide over (64 square inches total). Cabinetry, chairs or other office furnishings and equipment can be positioned in such a way that the door slides behind them when it is opened.' +

    '        <h2>Advances in Glass Sliding Door Design</h2>' +
    '        <p>' +
    '        <strong>Glass sliding office doors are not new. But most designs are both costly and bulky due to heavy metal framing and sliding mechanisms.</strong> Compare these older sliding doors to the sleek dramatic design of <a href="http://alurwalls.com/glass-wall" title="ALUR glass wall">ALUR frameless</a> sliding glass doors with &frac12;&quot; thick tempered glass. Glass door panels are available in sizes to 4 feet wide by 10 feet high. They blend beautifully with glass walls and unlike pivot doors they do not intrude into hallways or work areas when opened.' +
    '        </p>' +
    '        <p>' +
    '        <strong>All in all they add style and class to individual offices, collaboration and conference rooms, reception areas and other spaces.</strong> As an added feature their thin design requires a much smaller footprint than conventional sliding office doors. An optional &ldquo;soft close&rdquo; mechanism is also available that gently closes the door for improved function and convenience.' +
    '        </p>' +
    '        <h2>Features to Look for in Sliding Glass Doors</h2>' +
    '        <p>' +
    '        <strong>Ease of operation ranks high, especially for large doors.</strong> The heavy-duty multi-roller mechanism for ALUR sliding glass doors supports the weight of glass panels up to 4 x 10 feet in size (300 lbs.). It is completely concealed on the back side of the top frame and therefore not visible from the front. So smooth is the operation that only 5 pounds of lateral pressure is required for opening and closing, thereby conforming to ADA requirements.' +
    '        </p>' +
    '        <p>' +
    '        <strong>The multi-roller mechanism and discreet floor guide obviate the need for dirt trapping floor channels</strong> required for some sliding door designs to keep doors on track during opening and closing. As with ALUR demountable glass walls with a 36 STC rating, the companion sliding glass doors are designed for maximum sound attenuation. When closed they are sealed on all 4 edges to keep conversations private either inside or outside the workspace.' +
    '        </p>' +
    '        <p>' +
    '        <strong>Sliding door handles and locking mechanisms should meet building code requirements and be ADA compliant.</strong> Digital images, decorative films, patterned or frosted glass are options to provide visual privacy and to keep visitors or staff from walking into closed glass office doors.' +
